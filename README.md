Chromegle
==================
A Javascript Chrome Extension for Omegle, certified for Chrome 88 and above. Just as a side-note, I used this project to teach myself the basics of the JS language and jQuery library, and while IntelliJ did a good job getting me up-to-date on the latest practices, I am a novice, and the code is not going to be spectacular.
