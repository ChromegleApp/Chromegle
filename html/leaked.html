                        Hey stranger, your real IP address has been leaked and is being detected by Omegle.

                    <h3 style="width: 100%; font-size: 15px; margin-top: -2px;">Why should I care?</h3>
                    <p style="margin-top: -7px; font-size: 12px;">
                        Omegle abuses a vulnerability in browsers known as the
                        <span style="color: rgba(49,166,231,255); cursor: pointer;" onclick="window.open('https://surfshark.com/webrtc-leak-test')">WebRTC Leak</span>
                        to detect your real IP address when you are on a VPN and are using your microphone/webcam.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This issue only happens with <strong>poor quality</strong> VPN providers that "pretend" to be a VPN while only sending your HTTP traffic
                        through proxies (browser extension VPNs).
                        <br/><br/>
                        The VPN you are using currently is <strong>vulnerable</strong> to the WebRTC leak, and Omegle can tell you are on a VPN. Because of this, they
                        <strong>more than likely</strong> will block you from being able to connect to video chats on Omegle.
                    </p>
                    <h3 style="width: 100%; font-size: 15px; margin-top: -4px;">What should I do?</h3>
                    <p style="margin-top: -7px; font-size: 12px;">
                        Change VPN providers. In the interest of remaining a neutral party, Chromegle will not suggest a specific provider to use.
                        <br/><br/>
                        We have instead compiled <span style="color: rgba(49,166,231,255); cursor: pointer;" onclick="window.open('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14FF7GixHgU3byH4FSEuA_SW8q6oNXUet6H61ErMT0P4/edit?usp=sharing')">a definitive list</span> of providers both vulnerable and not vulnerable to this issue.
                        This uses third-party data and may be outdated, so please only use it as an advisory when testing your own VPNs against this issue.
                        <br/><br/>
                        When you switch VPNs, to check if you have fixed the issue reload Omegle and start a video chat.
                        If this menu doesn't show up anymore, you're good to go!
                        <br/><br/>
                        Finally, <strong>DO NOT disable WebRTC.</strong> The goal is for your VPN to "leak" your fake IP address. If it doesn't
                        leak <i>any</i> address (i.e if it detects you trying to protect yourself), Omegle will block you anyways.
